Note that code with a \*.cu or \*.cuh suffix is written in CUDA. The various CUDA functions can be found [in this set of reference pages](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-math-api/modules.html#modules). Code with an \*.hlsl suffix is in the High Level Shading Language, with its [function reference here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/dx-graphics-hlsl-intrinsic-functions).

## Releases

Errata for the book [is available](errata.md).

Release v1.0 corresponds to the code in the published book, with three corrections to Chapter 16:

Page 226: "float SampleLinear( float a, float b ) {" should have a "float u" parameter for the random variable, i.e., "float SampleLinear( float u, float a, float b ) {"

Page 235, file ConcentricSquareMapping.cpp: The case "a == 0 && b == 0" is not handled and can result in division by 0; above line 3 add "if (b == 0) b = 1;"

Page 242, file PhongDistribution.cpp: Line 1 of the code at the top, change "1+s" to "2+s"
